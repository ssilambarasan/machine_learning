Concrete Strength Prediction
Problem Statement
To predict the concrete strength using the data available in file "concrete.csv". Apply feature engineering and model tuning to obtain a score above 85%.

Resources available

he data for this project is available in file https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/concrete/compressive/

Attribute information Given are the variable name, variable type, the measurement unit, and a brief description. The concrete compressive strength is the regression problem. The order of this listing corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of the database.
